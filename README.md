# Simple PyTorch AI Model

This repository contains a simple linear regression model implemented in PyTorch.  
It demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing with NumPy and Pandas  
- Model definition using `torch.nn.Module`  
- Training loop with gradient descent  
- Loss visualization with Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
